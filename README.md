Head tracking using an external camera and aligning the virtual rendering of head with its real-world counterpart while visualizing through an AR headset.

The AR headset used: MagicLeap One
External camera used: Intel Realsense D415.

UnityProject-HeadTracking-0.24.0-9.3.6: Unity project to build the app on MagicLeap.
Unity project was built and tested on: Unity version: 9.3.6, mlsdk 24.0 and Lumin OS 0.98.10 

TrackingwExternalCamera: Python code to interface with Realsense and perform head tracking.

The head pose estimation is performed based on SolvePnP. More details about SolvePnP can be found here: https://learnopencv.com/head-pose-estimation-using-opencv-and-dlib/
